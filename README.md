# SCC-Treatment-Analysis-Pymaceuticals
# Summary: 

The research aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different drug regimens in treating SCC tumors in mice. A total of 249 mice were included in the study, and various treatments were administered to assess tumor development over 45 days. In this study, a randomized control trial design was implemented, with mice randomly assigned to different treatment groups.
	The results of this study indicated the following:
- Capomulin and Ramicane reduced the tumor size better than other drug regimens.
- In the lineplot for the Capomulin treatment of mouse I509, we see a decline in tumor volume at 20 days which continues as more time passes. 
- The least effective drugs administered were Infubinol and Ceftamin as indicated in the box plot showing the distribution of the tumor volume for each treatment group. 
- There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume, as the mouse weight increases, so does the average tumor volume.
